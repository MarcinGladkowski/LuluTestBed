# LuluTestBed

LuluTestBed is a simple web application built with Python and Flask. It simulates a
record store inventory and online shopping application. The application is meant to
provide an environment for teams to evaluate testing frameworks, tools, and techniques
against a realistic, but inconsequential application. It also aims to provide all
these things to individual users who are trying to learn how to use these tools.

The application aims to provide the following features:
* Wide variety of web components to evaluate browser automation tools.
* Different groups of users and a variety of use-cases to evaluate performance testing tools
* REST endpoints to evaluate integration testing tools
* Multiple UIs written in different JS frameworks

As of writing this, LuluTestBed is in its early stages of development, and many of
these features do no yet exist. This repository is open for all to use, modify, and
distribute. Contributors are encouraged and welcome.
